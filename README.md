# NOTE: Repo will not be updated for a month, as i will be rewriting this whole mess from start using the [ASTRO Framework](https://astro.build/). 
# The License will also be changed.  
The reason i will not update for a month is that i am currently working on other stuff and i don't really want to give 100% of my time to this and since i am learning a new framework, i think it'll be better to just forget this and migrate to the website with astro framework later on.

Also i realized many many many security issue wiht this stuff i made.
